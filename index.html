                <p>So yeah as you can see i have never been one of the creative kind, i did'nt expect that much creative
                    freedom so i got kind of stuck.</p>
                <p>However i find this as an excelent oportunity to talk about somenthing important, my cat</p>
                <p>My cat are weird, i have two, ther are siblings and are equally weird <br> they stay up at nigth
                    and meow to the void or play with each other.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Sometimes they meow at the door as if asking me to open it</p>
                <p>If i open the door they stay inside and look at me confused</p>
                <p>I think i may be dumb</p>
                <p>I think they enjoy it</p>

                <h1>Cats are weird in general</h1>
                <p>I think cats are weird in general</p>
                <p>Differently from dogs or other domestic animals, cats don't seem too interested on humans</p>
                <p>But i don't think they just hate us <strong>(i don't deny it either)</strong> I just think they are weird
                    animals</p>
                <p>they have a weird way of showing affection, wich can include </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staring at you</li>
                    <li>Meowing at you at 3 a.m</li>
                    <li>Biting on your feet</li>
                    <li>Licking your face</li>
                    <li>Purring at you nonstop</li>
                    <li>Sleeping on your lap</li>
                    <li>Sleeping on your bed</li>
                    <li>Sleeping on your head</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I think cats are just weird by nature</p>
                <p>in this case mine work just as intended.</p>

                <p>On top of that, cats in general seem to like me</p>
                <p>Maybe i am the werid one.</p>

                <p>I think my cats are weird but not dumb</p>
                <p>It may not be evident but i love them</p>
                <p>Even if they wake me up at nigth o walk on my keyboard</p>
                <p>Why would anyone not like cats?</p>
                <p>I mean they are really cool, they have more bones than us and are small and soft</p>
                <p>I think cats are cool even if they are weird</p>
                <p>Both my cats even have a cool pattern on their heads</p>

                <h1>More cat</h1>
                <p>Cathegory theory should be about cats</p>
                <p>In fact i could write a entire thesis about cats</p>
                <p>My cat may be weird but i really love him</p>
                <p>He is weird to me in general and i like that</p>
                <p>I think i should adopt more cats</p>
                <p>Anyway thats enough ranting about my cat, i just like him </p>
