            <h1>I have a weird cat</h1>
            <p>So yeah as you can see i have never been one of the creative kind, i did'nt expect that much creative
                freedom so i got kind of stuck.</p>
            <p>However i find this as an excelent oportunity to talk about somenthing important, my cat</p>
            <p>My cat is weird, he is a weird cat, he is a weird cat wich does weird things, <br> he gets up at nigth
                and meows to the void or just stares at me in a weird fashion</p>

                <figcaption>Example of werid cat staring</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Sometimes he meows at the door as if asking me to open it for him</p>
            <p>If i open the door he just stays inside and looks at me confused</p>
            <p>I wonder sometimmes if he is dumb or just weird</p>
            <p>I think he is just weird</p>
            <p>I think i may be the dumb one</p>

            <h1>Cats are weird in general</h1>
            <p>I think cats are weird in general</p>
            <p>Differently from dogs or other domestic animals, cats don't seem too interested on humans</p>
            <p>But i don't think they just hate us <strong>(i don't deny it either)</strong> I just think they are weird
                animals</p>
            <p>they have a weird way of showing affection, wich can include </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Staring at you</li>
                <li>Meowing at you at 3 a.m</li>
                <li>Biting on your feet</li>
                <li>Licking your face</li>
                <li>Purring at you nonstop</li>
                <li>Sleeping on your lap</li>
                <li>Sleeping on your bed</li>
                <li>Sleeping on your head</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think cats are just weird by nature</p>
            <p>in this case mine works just as intended.</p>

            <p>On topof that cats in general seem to like me</p>
            <p>Maybe i am the werid one.</p>

            <h1>Defense of my weird cat</h1>
            <p>I think my cat is weird but i don't think he is dumb</p>
            <p>It may not be evident but i love that cat</p>
            <p>Even if he wakes me up at nigth o walks on my keyboard</p>
            <p>Why would anyone not like cats?</p>
            <p>I mean they are really cool, they have more bones than us and are small and soft</p>
            <p>I think cats are cool even if they are weird</p>
            <p>My cat even has a cool pattern on his head</p>

            <h1>More cat</h1>
            <p>Cathegory theory should be about cats</p>
            <p>In fact i could write a entire thesis about cats</p>
            <p>My cat may be weird but i really love him</p>
            <p>He is weird to me in general and i like that</p>
            <p>I think i should adopt more cats</p>
            <p>Anyway thats enough ranting about my cat, i just like him </p>
